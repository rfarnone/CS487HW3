Part 1 of this project required making a CNN using ResNet-50 to categorize 43 different types of traffic signs. After creating a CNN with a required 90% accuracy we implemented Black-box Boundary attacks one of which was untargeted while the second was targeted. Through the Jupyter Notebook file there are tables recording the results of the model and the attacks and it closes each attack with a paragraph describing the attacks respectively.
Part 2 of this project required making a CNN using VGG16 to categorize paintings by 10 different artists. After creating this model we used the Cleverhans library to implement FGSM and PGD attacks on the model. We then used the FGSM adversarial images to implement Adversarial Training defense. The original model needed to fufill a 70% accuracy, while the trained model needed better than a 40% accuracy on the FGSM adversarial images. There are tables detailing the results of the model before and after the adversarial training and a paragraph describing the affect of training the model with this specific dataset.
